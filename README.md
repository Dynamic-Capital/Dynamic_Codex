# Telegram Dynamic Pool Bot Setup

This README provides instructions for setting up the Telegram Dynamic Pool Bot.

The project uses Supabase Edge Functions. Make your code changes in
`supabase/functions/telegram-bot/index.ts` and push to GitHub.
Supabase automatically deploys updates via GitHub Actions, so you do not need
Deno installed locally.

**Note:** The GitHubâ†’Supabase sync may take several seconds to complete.
